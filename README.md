Personal Library Management

An app designed to help users organize and share their libraries. 
The users can have 2 roles: library owner and library viewer. A library owner can edit his own library (add books from existing or create new ones). He can also view the libraries of other people. (library owner could be a PRO feature)
A library viewer can only see other people's libraries.
The app will be based on a rest api.

Branches:
master-1 : iOS version
master-2 : React Native version
backend : server (C#)
