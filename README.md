Personal Library Management

An app designed to help users with vast libraries. Its main role is to help one easily find a book  by dividing the entire library in areas. The user can search for a book by title or by author (or both) and the app will tell him in which part of the library to look for it (similar to the way public libraries work at indexing the books). The user can also add a book (and add its author if it doesn't already exist), assign it to a specific area. An isbn, publisher and whether the book is lent to someone are other types of info that can be submitted. 
The users can have 2 roles: library owner and library viewer. A library owner can edit his own library (add books from existing or create new ones). He can also view the libraries of other people. (library owner could be a PRO feature)
A library viewer can only see other people's libraries.
The app will be based on a rest api.
